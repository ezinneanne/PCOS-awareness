Abstract 

Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a frequent diagnosis in 
oligomenorrheic  and  infertile  Nigerian  women.  However,  to  date  there  is  a 
paucity of data on the prevalence of PCOS in Nigerian women. The objective 
of this study was to investigate the prevalence of PCOS in a cross-section of 
women attending Infertility Clinics in Benin City, Nigeria using the three as-
sessment  criteria  namely:  the  1990  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH),  the 
2003  Rotterdam and 2006 Androgen Excess Society (AES) criteria. Method: 
Four  hundred  and  twenty-one  consecutive  infertile  premenopausal  women 
aged 18 - 45 years were recruited and evaluated with a proforma that elicited 
information  about  their  maternal  and  reproductive  health  history.  Blood 
samples were analyzed for hormone levels using standard immunoassay pro-
cedures, while trans-vaginal ultrasound scan was carried out to determine the 
presence of ultrasonic features of PCOS. The control group comprised of eu-
menorrheics  (n  =  180).  Results:  An  estimated  prevalence  of  biochemical 
hyperandrogenism (BHA) was as high as 20.9% (88 women), while 3.6% (15 
women)  presented  with  clinical  hyperandrogenism  (CHA).  Also  the  preva-
lence of polycystic ovaries (PCO) was 13.8%. The prevalence of PCOS based 
on  NIH,  Rotterdam  and  AES  criteria  was  16.9%  (71  women),  27.6%  (116 
women)  and  20.7%  (87  women)  respectively.  However,  women  with  PCOS 
were significantly younger and had higher total testosterone levels (p = 0.001) 
when compared to controls. Conclusion: The prevalence of PCOS is as high 
in the population under study as in other prevalence studies. The hormonal 
investigations were clinically useful in assessing the prevalence rates. Howev-
er, the recruitment criteria, together with the regional and racial factors may 
have  contributed  to  the  estimates  obtained,  and  the  high  incidence  of  bio-
chemical hyperandrogenism in this region.

1. Introduction 

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder, lead-

ing to several health complications, including menstrual dysfunction, infertility, 

hirsutism,  acne,  obesity,  and  metabolic  syndrome  [1].  It  appears  that  several 

factors  may  be  involved  in  its  development  but  the  pathophysiology  remains 

largely unknown. However many believe that PCOS appears to be familial, with 

its  various  aspects  differentially  inherited  from  one  generation  to  the  next  [2]. 

The three major diagnostic criteria of PCOS widely followed are criteria defined 

using  the  recommendation  of  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  in  1990 

[3],  2003  Rotterdam  Consensus  proposed  by  European  Society  of  Human  Re-

production  and  Embryology  (ESHRE)  and  American  Society  of  Reproductive 

Medicine  (ASRM)  [4]  [5],  and  the  criteria  proposed  in  2006  by  the  Androgen 

Excess Society (AES) [6]. 

The reported prevalence of PCOS ranges from 2.2% to 26% in various coun-

tries, depending on the recruitment process of the study population, the criteria 

used for its definition, and the method used to define each criterion [7] [8] [9]. 

A systematic review has shown that the prevalence under Rotterdam more than 

doubles that under the 1990 NIH, with the prevalence under the 2006 AES lying 

in-between  [10].  In  a  study  in  the  United  Kingdom  [11]  an  increase  of  8%  to 

26%  was  demonstrated  when  Rotterdam  criteria  were  used  instead  of  the  NIH 

[12].  Another  study  in  the  Middle  East  provided  a  related  data  [13]  of  an  in-

crease of 7.1% to 14.6% when Rotterdam criteria were used. 

From the reviewed literature, there has been no population-based  study  that 

estimated the prevalence, clinical and/or biochemical characteristics of PCOS in 

Nigeria. In a multi-country study of infertility in both developed and developing 

countries,  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  had  previously  shown  that 

the African region has a lower prevalence of anovulatory infertility as compared 

to more developed parts of the world [14]. There is emerging evidence that eth-

nicity  is  closely  associated  with  PCOS  phenotype  due  to  different  genetic  and 

environmental propensity to metabolic and hormonal aberrations [15] [16].   

However two studies in Nigeria [17] [18] reported the prevalence of PCOS as 

18.1%  and  12.2%  respectively,  but  these  studies  were  based  on  the  Rotterdam 

criteria. Therefore, given the impact of PCOS on the incidence of many disord-

ers, the current study aims at investigating the prevalence of this syndrome un-

der the NIH, Rotterdam and the AES criteria in a selected population.   

2. Methods 

2.1. Settings 

The study was carried out with a cross-section of consecutive women attending 

Infertility Clinics at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) and the 

Women’s  Health  and  Action  Research  Centre  (WHARC)  in  Benin  City,  Edo 

State,  Nigeria  between  April  1,  2009  and  November  30,  2010.  The  Infertility 

Clinic at UBTH is one of the largest such clinics in Nigeria and attends to a large 

catchment area spanning 8 contiguous States in the country. WHARC, a leading 

Nigerian  non-governmental  organization  (NGO),  also  runs  a  reproductive 

health clinic that provides conventional infertility treatment.   

2.2. Subjects 

A total of 421 women aged 18 - 45 years who gave their consent to participate in 
the fully informed study, were recruited into the study. The study procedure was 
explained to the subjects and their consent obtained. Medical, gynecological and 
obstetrics  history  were  obtained  from  each  patient  using  a  pre-prepared  stan-
dard  proforma.  Interviews  were  conducted  by  trained  nurses.  Clinical  history 
included elicitation of menstrual history (using basal body temperature and cer-
vical mucus secretion recorded with a calendar), previous medications and fam-
ily  history  of  diabetes  mellitus.  Menstrual  cycle  history  was  carefully  detected 
and  included  a  detailed  menstrual  history  of  the  previous  two  to  three  years. 
This was followed by detailed anthropometry [with emphasis on height, weight 
and body mass index (BMI; weight/height2, kg/m2)]. Using these criteria, normal 
weight  was  characterized  as  BMI  ranging  between  18.5  -  24.9,  overweight  be-
tween  25  -  29.9,  and  obesity  rising  above  30.0  [19].  Blood  pressure  measure-
ments  were  undertaken  with  subjects  in  the  sitting  position.  The  mean  arterial 
blood  pressure  (MABP)  was  calculated  by  adding  a  third  of  the  difference  be-
tween the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Physical examination was per-
formed  in  each  woman  by  a  gynecologist.  Hirsutism  was  classified  using  the 
modified  Ferriman-Gallwey  (mFG)  by  scoring  the  presence  of  terminal  hairs 
over  nine  body  areas  (i.e.  upper  lip,  chin,  chest,  upper  and  lower  abdomen, 
thigh,  upper  and  lower  back  and  upper  arms)  [20].  An  mFG  score  of  ≥6  was 
considered hirsutism. Presence or absence of acne was recorded by the gynecol-
ogist. Clinical hyperandrogenism (CHA) was diagnosed by the presence of hir-
sutism and/or acne [20]. The transvaginal ultrasound scan was carried out using 
the  Mindray  Digital  Ultrasonic  Diagnostic  Imaging  System  DP-6600  Model, 
Hamburg, Germany.   

2.3. Selection Criteria 

Women who completed the  proforma and had menstrual dysfunction (chronic 

oligomenorrhea/ammenorrhea) were further assessed using random blood sam-

ple for serum hormonal assays to exclude related or mimicking etiologies which 

included  thyroid  dysfunction,  hyperprolactinemia,  hypergonadotropic  hypogo-
nadism,  non-classic  congenital  adrenal  hyperplasia  (NCAH).  Those  who  com-

pleted  the  proforma  and  were  regular  cycling  women  had  day  3  and  day 

21serum hormonal investigations carried out. The day 21 progesterone (P4) as-

say  levels  were  used  to  confirm  ovulatory  status.  Women  with  P4  levels  <  4.0 

ng/ml  were  regarded  as  indicating  ovulatory  dysfunction,  while  P4  levels  ≥  4.0 

ng/ml were regarded as confirmed ovulation. All women who met the inclusion 

criteria and had total testosterone (TT) levels > 1.0 ng/ml were regarded as indi-

cating  hyperandrogenemia.  All  regular  cycling  women  with  no  polycystic  ova-

rian syndrome features, specifically no clinical and/or biochemical hyperandro-

genism and no chronic oligo/anovulation were regarded as eumenorrhea which 

formed the control group for the study. 

2.4. Defining PCOS 

Based  on  the  NIH  criteria,  PCOS  was  defined  as  a  combination  of  menstrual 

disorder (chronic oligo- or anovulation) and clinical and/or biochemical signs of 

hyperandrogenism, with the exclusion of related disorders. The Rotterdam crite-

ria  defined  PCOS  by  the  presence  of  any  two  of  the  following  three  criteria: 

menstrual  disorders,  clinical  and/or  biochemical  hyperandrogenism,  and  poly-

cystic  ovaries.  For  the  AES,  definition  was  analogous  to  the  Rotterdam  criteria 

but  excluded  women  with  only  menstrual  dysfunction  and  polycystic  ovaries. 

Menstrual dysfunction was defined as less than eight cycles per year. Specifically, 

the individual criteria were: menstrual history of less than eight cycles in a year, 

or  menstrual  cycles  less  than  26  days  or  more  than  35  days  in  length,  or  oli-

go-ovulation  which  was  day  21  -  24  (mid-luteal)  progesterone  (P4)  levels  <  4 

ng/ml  in  women  with  regular  menstrual  cycles.  Eumenorrhea  was  defined  as 

women  with  regular  menstrual  cycle  of  26  -  34  days  in  length,  P4  levels  ≥  4.0 

ng/ml with no signs of clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism nor poly-

cystic ovaries [7]. The eumenorrheics were taken as control subjects (N = 180). 

Biochemical  hyperandrogenism  (BHA)  was  defined  as  a  TT  and/or  FT,  A4 
and/or DHEAS levels above the upper 95th percentile of eumenorrheic women as 
reported  earlier  [7].  Specifically,  the  upper  normal  limit  for  TT  was  1.0  ng/ml, 

FT was 4.1 pg/ml, A4 was 2.6 ng/ml, and DHEAS was 2.2 ng/ml. Polycystic ova-

ries (PCO) was diagnosed by the presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary 

measuring 2 - 9 mm in diameter and/or increased ovarian volume greater than 

10 ml [21].

The  sample  size  was  calculated  to  find  a  prevalence  of  PCOS  of  15%  with  a 

confidence level of 95% and an accuracy or errors of 4%, which required the to-

tal of  307 women—so we decided to include all women that fulfilled the selec-

tion criteria during the study period. 

2.6. Assays 

Between  08:30  -  09:30  hour,  an  overnight  fasting  venous  blood  samples  were 

collected from the oligomenorrheics while an overnight day 3 and day 21 fasting 

venous  blood  samples  were  collected  from  the  regular  cycling  women.  Serum 

was stored at −20˚C until assayed. The  samples were  assayed for serum  follicle 

stimulating hormone (FSH; units per L), luteinizing hormone (LH; units per L), 

progesterone  (P4;  nanograms  per  ml),  estradiol  (E2;  picograms  per  ml),  total 

testosterone (TT; nanograms per ml), free testosterone (FT; picograms per ml), 

androstenedione  (A4;  nanograms  per  ml),  dehydroepiandrosterone  sulphate 

(DHEAS; micrograms per ml), prolactin (PRL; nanograms per ml), thyroid sti-

mulating  hormone  (TSH;  microunits  per  ml)  and  17  hydroxyprogesterone 

(17-OHProg; nanograms per ml) were measured. All hormones were measured 

by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  method  using DRG  kits [22]. 

Samples were batched at regular intervals for analysis to minimize the impact of 

inter-assay variability. Confirmed PCOS was established in those subjects whose 

evaluation  was  complete  and  met  the  criteria  described  above  while  the  preva-

lence of PCOS was calculated using the confirmed PCOS and those subjects who 

met  the  inclusion  criteria.  Inclusion  criteria  were  women  with  ovulatory  dys-

function and infertility. Exclusion criteria were women on hormonal therapy or 

other medical treatments whose medications could influence the hormonal assay 

results thereby affecting the prevalence estimates. 

2.7. Statistical Analysis 

All  statistical  analyses  were  carried  out  using  SPSS  17.0  version  for  Windows 

(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Means, standard deviations and Analysis of Va-

riance  (ANOVA)  test  were  calculated.  Descriptive  statistics  were  generated  to 

enable  comparisons  between  groups.  Duncan  multiple  range  test  was  used  for 

source of significance. Results were reported as the mean ± SD. P-value of <0.05 

was considered statistically significant.   

2.8. Ethical Consideration 

The Ethics and Research Committee of the UBTH approved the study proposal 

and issued the clearance certificate (ADM/E.22 A/VOL.VII/174). Fully informed 

consent was obtained from all women who participated in the study. 

3. Results

history  revealed  that  41.8%  (176  women)  were  oligomenorrheic,  while  58.2% 

(245 women) had regular menstrual cycles. Clinical examination of the women 

showed that 3.6% (15 women) had CHA (Table 1). Four (1.0%) of the 15 wom-

en were hirsute with F-G scores ≥ 6, while 11 (2.6%) of the 15 women had acne. 

None of the women had androgenic alopecia and none was on oral contraceptive 

pills. Hormone results obtained from the random blood  samples demonstrated 

that 20.2% (85 women) of the oligomenorrheic women had other related disorders. 

From  the  21.6%  (91  women)  who  were  oligomenorrheics  with  no  confounding 

causes, 47 women were identified as non-hyperandrogenic oligo menorrheics and 

44  women  as  hyperandrogenic  oligo  menorrheics  (Figure  1).  The  results  ob-

tained  from  the  day  21  serum  samples  of  the  regular  cycling  women  identified 

10% (42 women) as oligo-ovulatory (P4 < 4.0 ng/ml). Twenty one (21) of the 42 

oligo-ovulatory  women  did  not  show  BHA,  while  the  remaining  21  of  the  42 

women  demonstrated  BHA  (Figure  1).  Of  the  48.2%  (203  women)  who  were 

ovulatory (P4 ≥ 4.0 ng/ml), 5.4% (23 women) had BHA and 42.8% (180 women) 

were eumenorrheics and formed the control subjects (Figure 1). Altogether, 71, 

116, and 87 women fulfilled the NIH, Rotterdam, and AES criteria respectively 

for  the  diagnosis  of  PCOS.  Therefore,  the  prevalence  of  PCOS  obtained  from 

population  under  study  was  16.9%  (95%  CI:  13.4%  -  20.8%),  27.6%  (95%  CI: 

23.3% - 32.0%), 20.7% (95% CI: 16.9% - 24.9%) respectively. However, based on 

NIH criteria, the 23 of the 203 women who were ovulatory (P4 ≥ 4.0 ng/ml) and 

had hyperandrogenemia (TT > 1.0 ng/ml), were not included in the NIH preva-

lence  estimate.  From  Table  1,  the  distributions  of  the  PCOS  features  (CHA, 

BHA  and  PCO)  among  the  oligomenorrheics  and  the  regular  cycling  women 

were indicated. From the results of the hormone assay carried out, a total of 88 

(20.9%) women had BHA (TT > 1.0 ng/ml).  The result of the trans-vaginal ul-

tra-scan  (TV-US)  assessment  of  seventy-nine  women  revealed  that  58  (13.8%)

women had polycystic ovaries. The ANOVA comparison of the anthropometric 

and  hormonal  data  of  the  women  with  PCOS  and  the  control  group  using  the 

three assessment criteria are shown in Table 2. When compared with women in 

the  control  group,  women  with  PCOS  were  significantly  younger  in  age  (P = 

0.001), had significantly higher TT levels and LH:FSH ratio (P = 0.001). Statisti-

cally  significant  differences  were  observed  in  the  FSH  and  LH  levels  between 

women  with  PCOS  compared  to  control  subjects  (P  =  0.001).  However,  there 

were no statistically significant differences between the groups in mean (± SD) 

height, weight, BMI, SBP, DBP, MBP and MABP (P > 0.05). All women in the 

groups were overweight. From the proforma, among the PCOS and control sub-

jects  studied,  7.4%  (n  =  31)  and  2.4%  (n  =  10)  had  family  history  of  diabetes 

mellitus (DM) respectively. 

4. Discussion 

The current study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of PCOS in a cross 

section  of  women  attending  Infertility  Clinic  in  a  Southern  Nigerian  tertiary 

health  institution,  using  the  three  assessment  criteria.  There  is  no  study  in  the 

Sub-Saharan region that estimated the prevalence of PCOS in a selected popula-

tion using the three defined criteria. The prevalence rates obtained based on the 

1990  NIH,  2003  Rotterdam  and  the  2006  AES  criteria  were  16.9%  (95%  CI: 

13.4%  -  20.8%),  27.6%  (95%  CI:  23.3%  -  32.0%)  and  20.7%  (95%  CI:  16.9%  - 

24.9%)  respectively.  This  outcome  was  consistent  with  reports  from  other  stu-

dies [8] [11] [13] where the estimates based on the Rotterdam criteria increased 

by 1.5 - 2 times when compared to 1990 NIH criteria, and when compared with 

the  study  of  Tehrani  et al.  [13],  the  prevalence  under  the  2006  AES  laid 

in-between. Reports by Ding et al. [10] and Bozdag et al. [23] confirmed that the 

highest prevalence estimates are obtained for 2003 Rotterdam and the lowest for 

the  1990  NIH.  They  found  that  white  and  black  females  have  substantially

different risks of developing PCOS. They further suggested that under the same 

diagnostic  criterion  of  PCOS,  Chinese  and  Caucasian  females  are  less  likely  to 

develop  PCOS  compared  with  females  residing  in  the  Middle  East,  whereas 

Black females  majorly  African-Americans and  Afro-Brazilians tend to have the 

highest risks of developing PCOS. Therefore, this study is advantageous in terms 

of providing ethnicity-specific estimates. The estimates of PCOS from database 

studies and community based studies [10] are lower than those reported in this 

study  which  underlies  Bozdag et al.  [10]  observation  that  PCOS  is  a  syndrome 

without  much  public  awareness  and  PCOS  patients  often  do  not  seek  care. 

However, most of the studies involving selected female population [24] [25] [26] 

[27] reported high PCOS prevalence which demonstrated the outcome regarding 

the types of recruitment. 

The distribution pattern associated with specific PCOS phenotypes outlined in 

Table 2, has shown the prevalence rates in the present study in ascending order 

as CHA 3.6% (n = 15), polycystic ovaries 13.8% (n = 58), BHA 20.9% (n = 88) 

and  oligomenorrhea  21.6%  (n  =  91).  Hirsutism  contributed  1%  to  the  CHA  in 

this study and is comparable to the 2.8% identified by Knochenhauer et al. [28] 

but  lower  than  the  estimates  obtained  by  Asuncion  et al.  [29],  Diaman-

ti-Kandarakis et al. [30]  and  March et al. [8].  Hsu et al. [31] had reported that 

28%  -  35%  of  Asian  women  with  PCOS  present  with  hirsutism,  an  estimate 

much higher than demonstrated in this study. Hsu [32] suggested that hirsutism 

is  not  only  a  function  of  circulating  androgen  levels  but  can  be  determined  by 

genetic factors. Whereas this study reported a prevalence  rate as high as 20.9% 

for BHA and Yang et al. [33] reported 33%, in contrast Hussein and Alalaf [27] 

reported a lower rate of BHA about 7.5% in Kurdish women. Regarding clinical 

presentation, excess androgen has been suggested to have a principal role in di-

agnostic criteria. The estimate (21.6%) of oligomenorrhea in this study is com-

parable with the 23.8% reported by March et al. [8] among Australian  women. 

The  present  study  had  oligomenorrhea  and  BHA  as  the  most  common  PCOS 

component  while  Hsu  [32]  identified  PCO  morphology  as  the  most  common 

PCOS component in Taiwanese women. Taken together the implications of eth-

nic variation on screening and diagnosis, management priorities and response to 

treatment  should  be  taken  into  account,  when  managing  women  from  distinct 

ethnic  background,  as  well  as  in  developing  management  guidelines  of  PCOS 

[10].   

PCOS women were also younger in age (p = 0.001) with elevated TT levels (p 

=  0.001)  compared  to  control.  Other  reports  have  revealed  that  PCOS  women 

were significantly younger (p = 0.00061) [27]. This study has demonstrated that 

LH:FSH  ratio  is  a  valuable  diagnostic  tool  in  evaluating  Nigerian  women  with 

PCOS. Alnakash and Al-Taee [34] reported that not all women with PCOS pos-

sess hormonal and biochemical changes suggestive of the disease. However, the 

finding of elevated LH:FSH ratio was not included as part of the recommenda-

tion for PCOS.   

This  study  has  important  strengths  and  weaknesses.  The  strength  lies  in  the 

authors’ study of consecutive women attending Infertility Clinics in a large ur-

ban  city  in  Nigeria.  Only  a  few  women  attending  the  clinics  during  the  period 

opted out of the study, indicating that the results are externally valid for popula-

tions  of  infertile  women  in  the  region.  Additionally,  the  use  of  robust  clinical 

and hormonal parameters in line with international recommendations indicates 

that not only are the results internally valid, but that they can be compared with 

results obtained from other populations. The major limitation of this study was 

that only a few proportion of women in this population actually present in hos-

pital for investigation and treatment. Therefore, the extent of under-representation 

of actual infertile women becomes apparent. Another limitation was the lack of 

funding  which  did  not  allow  for  the  estimation  of  free  testosterone  for  all  the 

women in the study. Likewise trans-vaginal ultrasound was not conducted for all 

the  women  with  PCOS  features.  Hormone  assays  are  often  not  available  or  af-

fordable to many clinics in Africa, and the use of ultrasongraphy for the assess-

ment of ovulation in Africa is limited by the high cost of ultrasound equipment 

[35].   

5. Conclusion 

In  conclusion,  the  economic  burden  of  PCOS  is  significantly  huge.  Therefore 

accurate and early diagnosis and intervention of the disease is necessary not only 

to  prevent  future  health  comorbidities,  but  also  to  reduce  financial  cost  and

burden,  thereby  ensuring  good  health  and  well-being.  This  study  has  provided 

insights  into  the  contribution  of  PCOS  to  the  high  burden  of  infertility  in  the 

Sub-Saharan region; and showed that the prevalence of PCOS is high in infertile 

Nigerian  women.  Clinical  approaches  and  hormonal  investigations  for  manag-

ing PCOS as part of the treatment of infertility are imperative.
