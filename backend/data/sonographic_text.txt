ABSTRACT 
Keywords:  
incidence; infertility; metropolis; polycystic 
ovarian syndrome 

Introduction:  Polycystic  ovarian  syndrome  (PCOS)  is  a  hormonal 
disorder  that  develops  after  puberty  in  women  within  the  age  of 
reproduction. It is one of the leading causes of infertility in women all 
over  the  world  and  a  common  endocrine  disorder  in  females, 
generally seen in women of reproductive age. Its exact cause is not 
known,  but  some  of  the  risk  factors  include  genetic  factors,  insulin 
resistance,  obesity,  and  hormonal  imbalance.  PCOS  has  a  genetic 
component that can be passed down through the family line. Insulin 
resistance  has  also  been  traced  to  be  one  of  the  prime  causes  of 
PCOS, especially in obese women. 

Aims:  The  study  aims  to  determine  the  incidence  of  PCOS  among 
women presenting for ultrasound with a clinical diagnosis of primary 
or secondary infertility within Abakpa metropolis.  

Methods:  This  is  a  retrospective  study  of  100  infertility  cases 
collected across two diagnostic centers within Abakpa metropolis. The 
study was carried out between the months of July 2021 and July 2023.  
Results: Out of the 100 infertility cases identified in these diagnostic 
centers,  46  of  them  indicated  primary  infertility,  47  indicated 
secondary  infertility  and  6  of  them  were  uncertain.  Among  the  100 
cases  that  were  reported  to  these  centers  because  of  infertility,  31 
(31% of them) were diagnosed with PCOS. It is therefore noted that 
PCOS has had an incidence of 31% among women with infertility in 
Abakpa metropolis in the last 2 years. Ovarian cysts showed the most 
common association with PCOS. Other common associations include 
fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometrial mass, anovulation, 
amenorrhea and cervical cyst, oophoritis and myometrial lesions. 

Conclusions:  Polycystic  Ovarian  Syndrome  has  been  identified  as 
one of the major pathologies associated with infertility in women. In 
this research, PCOS was found among majority of women who made 
up  number  of  reported  infertility  cases.  PCOS  was  also  associated 

with  several  comorbidities  that  were  diagnosed  using  ultrasound. 
From this study, the  most  common comorbidity among women with 
PCOS is ovarian cysts at 47% while the myometrial lesion is the least 
with 1%. 

1. Introduction 

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that develops after puberty in women 
within the age of reproduction[1]. It is one of the leading causes of infertility in women all over the 
world and a common endocrine disorder in females, generally seen in women of reproductive age[1]. 
Its exact cause is not known, but some of the risk factors include genetic factors, insulin resistance, 
obesity, and hormonal imbalance. PCOS has a genetic component that can be passed down through 
the family line. If one is born into a family that has PCOS, there is an increased tendency to have it. 
Insulin  resistance  has  been  traced  to  be  one  of  the  prime  causes  of  PCOS,  especially  in  obese 
women[1].  Being  overweight  can  cause  PCOS  due  to  excess  adipose  fat,  which  predisposes  to 
hormonal imbalance and inflammation. Lifestyle: Regular exercise helps the body burn fat, improve 
insulin sensitivity, and balance hormonal levels. Hormonal imbalance: PCOS involves imbalances in 
the levels of estrogen and progesterone and increased levels of androgens. 

Infertility is a medical condition in which there is an involuntary failure to conceive after trying for at 
least 12 months of unprotected sexual interaction[2]. Infertility is a universal health issue, and it has 
been estimated that 8 to 12% of couples worldwide are infertile[2]. Estimates suggest that between 
48  million  couples and 186  million  individuals  live  with infertility  globally;  half  of  these couples are 
living in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia[2]. According to the World Health Organization 
(WHO), PCOS impacted 116 million women (3.4%) worldwide. Depending on the population analysis 
and the criteria used for diagnosing PCOS in India, the range is from 3.7 to 22.5%[2]. Many studies 
conducted on the incidence of PCOS have shown an increased incidence in low- and middle-income 
countries, but in Nigeria, there is little to no evidence of studies showing the incidence of PCOS in 
women  with  infertility  in  the  southeast  region  of  Nigeria,  even  when  observations  and  anecdotal 
reports suggest a prevalence in the aforementioned region[2]. In PCOS, the ovaries usually appear 
to be twice the normal size, are gray-white with a smooth outer cortex, and measure 0.5–1.5 cm in 
diameter. Polycystic ovaries are characterized by the presence of up to twelve (12) immature follicles 
9 mm in diameter, appearing as a circular area at the periphery with a central stroma. It shows a ring-
like appearance at the periphery[3]. 

Significant efforts have been made to categorize PCOS during the past few decades, yet there is 
still debate on which criteria should be used globally. Unfortunately, the foundation required to create 
an evidence based definition of the syndrome has not been sufficiently provided by the epidemiologic 
and/or  fundamental  research  data  that  are  now  available.  50%  of  PCOS  afflicted  females  are 
overweight. (5) In women with polycystic ovarian disease, obesity causes changes in type 2 diabetes 
and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). For young women with PCOS, hirsutism, irregular menstrual 
cycles, and acne are the most discouraging symptoms. Although PCOS is common and has a wide 
range of clinical symptoms, its precise pathophysiology is still not well understood. A growing amount 
of research shows that women with PCOS are more likely than other women to experience pregnancy 
difficulties.  Because  of  this,  PCOS  is  not  only  associated  with  metabolic  abnormalities,  irregular 
menstrual  cycles,  or  infertility  as  has  been  previously  reported,  but  is  also  becoming  more  widely 
acknowledged  as  a  problem  with  gestational  diabetes(GDM),  pregnancy-induced  hypertension, 
preeclampsia, premature delivery rate, neonatal birth weight, cesarean section rate and admission to 
a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which are all considered to be adverse pregnancy outcomes 
of PCOS during pregnancy[4]. 

    Depending on the diagnostic criteria standards used, PCOS prevalence has been reported to range 
within 2.2% to 26% globally[5][6]. The three most popular diagnostic criteria for PCOS are the 1990 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendation, the 2003 Rotterdam Consensus, proposed by 
the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and American Society of 
Reproductive  Medicine  (ASRM),  and  the  2006  criteria  proposed  by  the  Androgen  Excess  Society 
(AES)[7]. According to a thorough analysis, the prevalence under Rotterdam is  more than twice as 
high as it was  under the 1990 NIH, with the 2006 AES rate falling somewhere in the middle. In a 
study conducted in the United Kingdom[8], it was shown that using Rotterdam criteria rather than NIH 
criteria resulted in an increase of 8% to 26%. When Rotterdam criteria were applied, a different study 
in the Middle East, which supplied relevant data, showed an increase of 7.1% to 14.6%[9].  
In a multi-country study of infertility in both developed and developing countries, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) previously showed that the African region had a lower prevalence of anovulatory 
infertility, which is primarily known as PCOS, as compared to more developed parts of the world[10]. 
Increasing  amounts  of  evidence  point  to  a  connection  between  ethnicity  and  PCOS  since  various 
ethnic  groups  have  varying  genetic  and  environmental  predispositions  to  metabolic  and  hormonal 
disorders[11].  Two  studies  conducted  in  Nigeria  reported  the  prevalence  of  PCOS  as  18.1%  and 
12.2%, respectively, and these studies were based on the Rotterdam criteria[12]. Therefore, given 
the impact of PCOS on the incidence of infertility, the current study aims to investigate the incidence 
of this syndrome with infertility based on its sonographic presentation in a selected population. 
PCOS is seen as one of the most common reproductive disorders faced by women of reproductive 
age.  Research  has  shown  that  90–95%  of  anovulatory  women  seeking  infertility  treatment  have 
PCOS[13]. 

There is limited research and little documentation on the trend of sonographic assessment of 
PCOS  in  women  with  infertility,  thereby  restricting  effective  treatment  planning  and  limiting  the 
potential for appropriate intervention to improve fertility outcomes[13]. Therefore, this retrospective 
study focuses on the sonographic assessment and incidence of PCOS in women with infertility in the 
Abakpa metropolis of Enugu state, Nigeria. 

2. Methodology  
2.1 Study Design 

A retrospective study was used in this research. The study focused on patients who underwent 
ultrasound examination for infertility at two diagnostic centers in Abakpa metropolis. The study 
period spanned from July 2021 to July 2023 

2.2 Study Setting 

Data for study was gathered at His Grace diagnostic center and Life Chart diagnostic center in Abakpa 
metropolis, Enugu state, South-Eastern Nigeria. The two centers were relevant as they catered to the 
needs of majority of the people living in the metropolis. Abakpa is a densely populated residential and 
commercial area located in Enugu East, Enugu State, Nigeria. It is one of the major suburbs of the 
Enugu metropolis located 8km west of Akanu Ibiam International Airport and 7km north of the city 
center. 

2.3 Data Collection 

Data were retrospectively extracted from patient reports recorded in both soft and hard copy formats. 
Electronic data were retrieved using a flash drive, while hard copy records were manually extracted 
from patient logbooks. All records collected involved patients who presented with a clinical diagnosis 
of primary or secondary infertility and had undergone ultrasound examinations. This selection ensured 
that only cases relevant to infertility were considered.  

2.4 Variables Measured 

The key variables measured included: 

1.  Infertility diagnosis (primary, secondary, or uncertain). 
2.  Sonographic  findings  related  to  PCOS,  including  the  presence  of  ovarian  cysts  and  other 

associated conditions like fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and anovulation. 
A  total  of  100  patient  data  points  were  analyzed,  drawn  from  infertility  cases  observed  at  the 
diagnostic centers within the study period. 

2.5 Data Analysis 

The result of the research was analyzed using SPSS software version 25. Statistical tools such as 
frequency  and  percentages  were  employed  to  summarize  and  present  the  data,  allowing  the 
identification of key patterns, including the incidence of PCOS and its related comorbidities among 
women with infertility. 
3. Results  
Out of the 100 infertility cases identified in these diagnostic centres, 46 of them came in with primary 
infertility, 47 of them came in with secondary infertility and 6 of them were uncertain. Among the 100 
cases that were reported to these centres as a result of infertility, 31 (31% of them) were diagnosed 
with PCOS. It is therefore noted that PCOS has had an incidence of 31% among women with infertility 
in Abakpa metropolis in the last 2 years. (Table 1)

Among the 31 women diagnosed with PCOS, several comorbidities were identified through ultrasound 
findings.  Ovarian  cysts  were  the  most  prevalent,  affecting  47%  of  the  PCOS  cases.  Fibroids 
(myometrial mass) were found in 28% of the women. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) was present 
in  27%.  Endometrial  mass  was  identified  in  7%  of  the  cases.  Anovulation  and  amenorrhoea  were 
each observed in 5%. Cervical cysts were diagnosed in 4%, while enlarged ovaries were seen in 3%. 
Myometrial lesions were the least common, found in only 1% of the cases. These findings illustrate a 
high rate of ovarian cysts in women diagnosed with PCOS, confirming the association between this 
condition and various reproductive comorbidities. (Table 2)

4 Discussion 

4.1 Incidence of PCOS among women with infertility that reported at centers in Abakpa within the last 
2 years. 

Among the 100 respondents that reported to these centers as a result of infertility, 31 (31%) of them 
were diagnosed with PCOS. It is therefore noted that PCOS has an incidence of 31% among women 
with infertility in Abakpa in the last 2 years. These findings are related to some other findings of other 
researchers.  BAQAI  et  al.  (2010)  conducted  a  cross-sectional  study  to  assess  the  prevalence  of 
PCOS  among infertile women,  according to Rotterdam  criteria,  using  1210  participants  who  came 
into BIRDS OPD for fertility between January 2009 and December 2009. The result showed that the 
prevalence of PCOS was identified in 496 (40.9%) out of 1210 women who visited BIRDS OPD during 
the previous year. Farzana Arain et al. (2015) found that PCOS was found in 38.5% of female infertility 
cases[14].  Mavondo  et  al.  (2020)  (50)  conducted  a  cross-sectional  survey  on  the  prevalence  and 
ultrasound  presentations  of  polycystic  ovarian  syndrome  in  black  African  women  presenting  with 
infertility. The study showed 30.4% of the clients had polycystic ovaries[15]. Asgharnia, Mirblook, and 
Soltani  (2011)  who  conducted  a  cross-sectional  study  on  the  prevalence  of  Polycystic  Ovary 
Syndrome (PCOS) in High School Students in Rasht in 2009 According to NIH Criteria, found that 
PCOS  was  diagnosed  in  11.3%  of  the  girls[16].  Also,  Shreeyanta  K.C.  (2018)  carried  out  a  study 
aimed  to  find  out  the  prevalence  of  polycystic  ovarian  syndrome  among  medical  undergraduates. 
Results showed that out of 381 participants, the prevalence of polycystic ovarian syndrome was found 
to be 35 (9.18%)[17]. A 2022 systematic review on the prevalence of PCOS in India reported 10% 
using Rotterdam's criteria and AES criteria and 5.8% using the NIH criteria. The study concluded that 
evidence  from  the  research  should  be  used  by  policymakers,  government  organizations,  and 
healthcare  professionals  to  establish  guidelines  for  the  management  and  awareness  of  PCOS  in 
India[18]. 

4.2  Comorbidities  with  results  and  data  in  the  determination  of  the  incidence  of  PCOS  in  Abakpa 
metropolis  

The  researchers  identified  other  pathologies  found  among  the  women,  along  with  PCOS.  These 
included:  fibroids,  found  in  28%  of  the  women;  Pelvic  inflammatory  disease  found  in  27%  of  the 
patients; and ovarian cysts found in 47% of the women.  Also found among the women were enlarged 
ovaries (3%). Other comorbidities like cervical cysts were also found in 4% of the women.  Five of the 
women reported having amenorrhea. Also, five of the women reported anovulation.  This is in line 
with the study carried out by Farzana Arain et al. (2015), which revealed that together with PCOS, 
44% of the females had pelvic inflammatory disease, and also with the study by Mavondo et al. (2020), 
which reported that 46.4% had other pelvic pathology, and the rest, 23.2%, had normal pelvis scan 
results among black African women presented with infertility that had PCOS[14], [15]. According to 
our  findings  majority  of  women  who  were  infertile  and  diagnosed  of  PCOS  had  ovarian  cysts  and 
fibroids. This could be as a result that women with PCOS could have high levels of male hormones 
and irregular or no periods[19]. 

5.0 Conclusion 

Polycystic Ovarian  Syndrome  has  been  identified  as  one  of the major  pathologies associated  with 
infertility  in  women.  In  this  research,  PCOS  was  found  among  majority  of  women  who  made  up 
number of reported infertility cases. PCOS was also associated with several comorbidities that were 
diagnosed using ultrasound.
