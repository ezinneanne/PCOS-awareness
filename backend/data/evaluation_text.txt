Abstract
Background  Insulin resistance (IR) is known to be prevalent amongst women with polycystic ovarian syndrome 
(PCOS). Its presence has been linked to chronic anovulation and marked long term complications in women. Hence, 
identification and treatment of IR in women with PCOS is required to prevent the metabolic and reproductive 
complications of the disease. The aim of this study is to determine if serum adiponectin could be used as a surrogate 
marker for insulin resistance among women with PCOS.
Materials and methods  A total number of 148 consenting women with PCOS diagnosed using the Rotterdam 
criteria were recruited for this study. Fifty-two of these women had insulin resistance were compared with 96 of 
the women who did not have insulin resistance. The serum Adiponectin levels, fasting blood glucose and fasting 
insulin levels were assayed in all study participants. Insulin resistance was assessed in all the study participants using 
the Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Data were analyzed using relevant inferential 
statistics at 95% confidence interval and p value of < 0.05.
Results  The prevalence of insulin resistance among the study participants was 35.1%. Majority of the women (83.1%) 
had a high body mass index (BMI). More than half (68.2%) of the participants were in the age range of 21-30years and 
76.4% (113) were nulliparous. There was no statistically significant difference in the median adiponectin level among 
insulin resistant (3.735 ug/ml) and non-insulin resistant participants vs. (3.705 ug/ml) (p = 0.6762). Both univariate and 
multivariate regression analysis did not show a statistically significant relationship between adiponectin and insulin 
resistance in PCOS.
Conclusion  The prevalence of insulin resistance in women with PCOS is high and serum adiponectin is not a suitable 
surrogate marker of insulin resistance in women with PCOS.

Introduction
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition char-
acterized by menstrual dysfunction and clinical features 
of hyperandrogenism [1]. PCOS is a highly prevalent 
endocrine and metabolic disorder affecting women in 
the reproductive age group [2]. The major cause of this 
syndrome remains largely unknown, but findings from 
several studies suggests that PCOS might be a complex 
multigenic disorder with strong epigenetic and environ-
mental influences, including diet and lifestyle factors [3]. 
Polycystic ovarian syndrome is commonly associated 
with insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic disorders and 
cardiovascular risk factors [3].
Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a major challenge to 
public health due to its metabolic, reproductive and psy-
chological features [4]. PCOS has a prevalence of 5–10% 
in women of reproductive age with variance among race 
and ethnicities [5]. The highest reported prevalence has 
been 52% among the South Asian immigrants of whom 
49.1% had menstrual irregularity [6]. A previous study 
done in Southern Nigeria reported a prevalence of 12.2% 
[6].
PCOS is commonly diagnosed using Rotterdam criteria 
and is based on two out of three features: oligo- or an-
ovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), 
and polycystic ovaries [7]. Insulin resistance and hyperin-
sulinemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of 
this condition [7]. Insulin resistance is prevalent among 
women with PCOS and this is independent of obesity 
or body mass index (BMI) [8]. It is believed that about 
50–70% of women with PCOS would have Insulin resis-
tance [8]. Insulin and hyperinsulinemia have been impli-
cated in the pathogenesis as well as the immediate and 
long-term complications of PCOS [9].
Insulin resistance have been found to be involved in 
the development of metabolic syndrome and cardio-
vascular diseases in women with PCOS [10]. Hence, the 
determination of insulin resistance and its management 
is particularly important for women with PCOS. How-
ever, measuring insulin resistance is neither simple nor 
necessarily accurate [10]. Several methods for determin-
ing insulin resistance such as the hyperinsulinemic eug-
lycemic clamp which is the gold standard and others like 
the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance 
(HOMA-IR) are cumbersome, invasive and time con-
suming [11]. Thus, several surrogate markers have been 
proposed to facilitate and improve the determination of 
insulin resistance. One of such markers is Adiponectin, 
which is an adipocytokine secreted by mature adipocytes 
found in low levels in women with insulin resistance [10].
There are suggestions that adiponectin levels could be 
related to insulin resistance in PCOS [12]. However, the 
relationship between adiponectin levels and insulin resis-
tance in PCOS continues to be disputed. Various studies 
present conflicting findings; some indicate lower adipo-
nectin levels in PCOS, regardless of Body Mass Index 
(BMI) [13–15], while others report comparable adipo-
nectin levels in BMI-matched individuals with PCOS and 
controls [16, 17]. Results of some other studies support 
the finding that adiponectin levels are associated with 
insulin resistance [12, 18]. Despite the growing body of 
evidence in diverse populations, there is a notable pau-
city of data on this matter in sub-Saharan African popu-
lations. Hence, this study evaluated if serum adiponectin 
could be used as a surrogate marker for insulin resis-
tance. The specificity of the study population, comprising 
African women, addresses a gap in the existing literature, 
which often lacks representation from sub-Saharan Afri-
can populations.
Materials and methods
Study design
This was a comparative cross-sectional study that 
involved comparing 52 women diagnosed with PCOS 
and insulin resistance to 96 women diagnosed with 
PCOS without insulin resistance. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent and completed a semi-
structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected 
and analyzed for levels of fasting blood glucose, fasting 
insulin, and serum adiponectin.
Study area and population
The study took place at Lagos State University Teach-
ing Hospital Ikeja and Lagos Island Maternity Hospital, 
Lagos. It included women of reproductive age who had 
been diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam 
criteria in the Gynecology Clinics at the aforementioned 
hospitals.
Sampling
Convenience sampling was utilized to recruit consent-
ing women with PCOS who attended clinic days at both 
hospitals consecutively until the desired sample size was 
achieved. The study spanned a period of 2 years (Janu-
ary 21, 2020, to January 20, 2022). Participants were cat-
egorized into two groups: those with PCOS and insulin 
resistance as cases, and those with PCOS without insulin 
resistance as controls.
Sample size estimation
The sample size formula for comparative study was used 
in calculating the sample size [19]. The formula being as 
follows:
	
Sample size=r+1/r (Px) (1−Px) (Zβ+Zα)2
(P1−P2)2
r – Ratio of control to cases, this was taken as 1.
Px – the average proportion of PCOS with IR (exposed 
cases) + proportion of control (PCOS without IR)/ 2.
Zβ– Standard normal variant for power which is 1.28 
and 0.8 for 90% and 80% power respectively (1.28 for 90% 
power will be used).
Zα– 
Standard 
normal 
variant 
for 
level 
of 
significance = 1.96.
P1 – P2 = Effect size of difference in proportion expected 
based on previous studies. P1 is the expected proportion 
in study group based on maximum available proportion 
from previous studies while P2 is the proportion in con-
trol based on maximum available proportion from previ-
ous studies [20].
	
P1 = 0.36 (20)
P2 = 0.64 (20)
Sample size =1+1/1(0.36+ 0.64/2)(1−(0.36+0.64/2))(1.28+1 .96)2

With the attrition rate of 10%, the minimum sample size 
for this study was 74 (67 + 7) participants per group as 
10% [7] of the samples size was added to the ‘calculated 
sample size’ to account for the non-response rate. So, the 
total sample size for this study was calculated to be 148.
Data collection
Participation in the study was contingent upon obtain-
ing written consent from women. Recruitment was con-
ducted consecutively until the predetermined sample 
size was reached. Following eligibility confirmation, 
participants were situated in a quiet environment ensur-
ing individual privacy. A semi-structured questionnaire 
was utilized to gather baseline demographic data and 
reproductive characteristics. For participants with no 
education, the questionnaire was administered by the 
researcher, while others self-administered it.
Specimen collection
At the second gynaecology clinic visit where participants 
came for in a fasting state, blood samples were taken. Ten 
millilitres of blood were collected aseptically from the 
antecubital fossa vein with minimal stasis using pyrogen 
free disposable needles and syringes. Five millilitres of 
the blood were put into two separate labelled specimen 
tubes each: a Serum Separator Gel tube for the Serum 
Adiponectin and Serum Fasting Insulin assay and a Fluo-
ride Oxalate tube for the Fasting Plasma Glucose assay. 
These specimen tubes were transported to the laboratory 
within 1 to 2 h of specimen collection where they were 
stored at -200C till analysed within 72 h.
Specimen analysis
Serum adiponectin
Serum Adiponectin was assayed using a solid phase 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The assay was 
done using Abcam’s Human Adiponectin ELISA kit 
which measures the quantity of adiponectin in serum.
Fasting serum insulin
Fasting serum Insulin was assayed using a solid phase 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The assay was 
done using the Accu-Bind ELISA Microwells manufac-
tured by Monobind Inc, USA.
Fasting plasma glucose
Fasting plasma glucose was assayed using Glucose Mono 
Reagent (Glucose Oxidase/Peroxidase method) manufac-
tured by Atlas Medical, United Kingdom.
Determination of insulin resistance (IR)
Insulin Resistance was determined in all the study par-
ticipants using the Homeostasis Model Assessment for 
Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) which was calculated as;
	
HOMA −IR = fasting insulin (µU/ml) ×
fasting glucose (mmol/l)/22.5 (normalizing factor) .
A HOMA-IR value of > 2 was considered as Insulin Resis-
tance for this study [12].
HOMA-IR value of ≤ 2 was considered without Insulin 
Resistance in this study.
Data analysis
The SPSS version 22 was used for data entry, validation 
and analysis. Frequency tables was generated for all the 
categorical variables. To test for association between cat-
egorical variables in contingency tables, the chi-square 
test was used with p-values of less than 0.05 taken as 
significant. Multivariate regression analysis was used to 
evaluate for an association between serum adinopectin 
levels and insuline resistance in PCOS.
Results
A total number of 148 participants was recruited in this 
study. Table 1 shows the comparison of the socio-demo-
graphic characteristics of the study population. The mean 
age of the participants was 26.99 ± 4.88 years. Major-
ity (68.2%) of the participants were within the age range 
21–30 years. 58.78% of the participants were married, 
67.57% had tertiary education and 76.35% were para 0. 
Only about 16.89% of the participants had normal body 
mass index. There was a statistically significant difference 
in the body mass index between participants with insulin 
resistance PCOS and those with non-insulin resistance 
PCOS. Thus, the Body mass index among participants 
with insulin resistance PCOS was higher than the Body 
mass index of participants with non-insulin resistant 
PCOS (31.07 ± 5.05 Vs 28.82 ± 6.37, p-value = 0.006) and 
this was statistically significant. However, there was no 
statistically significant difference in the other socio-bio-
logical characteristics among participants with insulin 
resistance as compared to those without insulin resis-
tance PCOS.
Table 2 shows that there was no statistically significant 
relationship between serum adiponectin and the preva-
lence of insulin resistant PCOS in the study.
From Table 2, there was a statistically significant rela-
tionship between fasting blood sugar, fasting insulin 
level and insulin resistant PCOS. Thus, the proportion 
of women with impaired or high sugar level among the 
insulin resistant PCOS group was higher than the pro-
portion of women with impaired or high sugar level 
among women with non-resistant PCOS.
Similarly, the insulin level among participants with 
Insulin resistant PCOS was higher than the insulin level 
among the participants with non-insulin resistant PCOS.
There was no statistically significant difference in the 
median Adiponectin levels among insulin resistant and 
non-insulin resistant participants. 3.735ug/ml (1.055–
23.7585) Vs 3.705ug/ml (1.48–20.981), p-value = 0.68) as 
seen in Fig. 1. The maximum and minimum adiponectin 
level among insulin resistant and non-insulin resistant 
participants was 0.18ug/ml & 41.23 ug/ml and 0.18ug/ml 
& 41.128 ug/ml respectively.
Table 3 shows that there was no statistically significant 
relationship between age, fasting blood sugar, fasting 
insulin level and adiponectin level among insulin resis-
tant and non-insulin resistant PCOS participants. There 
is a significant association between BMI and adiponectin 
levels in PCOS women without insulin resistance, with 
a p-value of 0.03. This is not observed in PCOS women 
with insulin resistance.
Majority of the participants (89.19%) had menstrual 
irregularity, while just above half had infertility (54.73%), 
56.08% had hirsutism, and 52.70% of the participants had

acne. Only few participants (8.11%) had alopecia. There 
was no statistically significant relationship between the 
symptoms and insulin resistant PCOS. There was no 
statistically significant relationship between duration of 
symptoms and insulin resistant PCOS. (Table 4)
Following univariable regression model, BMI and fast-
ing insulin were statistically associated with insulin resis-
tant PCOS. However, there was no statistically significant 
relationship between adiponectin and insulin resistant 
PCOS at both univariable and multivariable regression 
modelling (Table  5). Nonetheless, there was a 2.3fold 
odds of diagnosing insulin resistant PCOS for every unit 
increase in the fasting insulin level after correcting for 
confounding variables. (Adj OR: 2.31, 95%CI: 1.61–3.31, 
P-value < 0.001)
Discussion
This study assessed serum adiponectin levels in women 
with PCOS and compared serum adiponectin in these 
women with and without insulin resistance. The preva-
lence of IR among women with PCOS was 35.1% in this 
study. This is considerably higher than what was reported 
in a study in Thailand in which 20% of women with PCOS 
had IR [21]. This may be due to the increased prevalence 
of deranged fasting blood glucose in this study compared 
to the one in Thailand (5.4% vs. 3.2%) [21]. Findings from 
this study shows that the median adiponectin levels 
among insulin resistant and non-insulin resistant partici-
pants was 3.735 (1.055–23.7585 µg/mL) and 3.705(1.48–
20.981 µg/mL) respectively and this was similar to a study 
done in Ireland which reported mean adiponectin levels 
of 3.03ug/ml in women with non-IR PCOS and 2.88ug/
ml in those with IR-PCOS after determining IR using 
HOMA [22]. However, in another similar study con-
ducted in Bulgaria which reported a mean of 8.85 ± 4.6 
ug/ml in women with IR-PCOS and 13.62 ± 7.55 ug/ml in 
women with non-IR PCOS, the median adiponectin lev-
els are found to be significantly higher than the median 
adiponectin levels reported in our study. This could be 
attributed to interracial variation in PCOS [23]. Interra-
cial variation in PCOS and adiponectin levels has been 
suggested in a study which showed that serum adiponec-
tin levels are lower in African Americans as compared to 
Caucasians [24]. In this study, there was no statistically 
Fig. 1  Box plot of the distribution of Adiponectin levels among insulin and non-insulin resistant participants 
significant difference in the median Adiponectin level 
among insulin resistant and non-insulin resistant partici-
pants (p = 0.68).
Furthermore, this study has shown that adiponectin 
may not be a good marker for insulin resistance (IR) in 
PCOS. There was no statistically significant relationship 
between adiponectin and insulin resistant PCOS at both 
univariable and multivariable regression modelling. Cor-
respondingly, results from research in Iran showed that 
after adjusting for the effect of age, BMI, blood glucose 
and waist circumference, insulin resistance was not asso-
ciated with adiponectin levels [25]. The two subpopula-
tions that exist in women with PCOS; one with insulin 
resistance of possible different etiologies and another 
without insulin resistance. These etiologies include adi-
posity, insulin receptor mutation, and unknown causes 
that could not be readily identified. These undefined 
interactions, further explains why adiponectin may not 
be a reliable marker of insulin resistance in the general 
population of women with PCOS.
However, there was 2.3-fold odds of diagnosing insulin 
resistant PCOS for every unit increase in the fasting insu-
lin level after adjusting for confounding variables. (Adj 
OR: 2.31, 95%CI: 1.61–3.31, p-value < 0.001). This corrob-
orates with results from another study by Koleva et al., 
[23] who found fasting plasma glucose and fasting insu-
lin to be significantly elevated in women with IR PCOS, 
compared to women with non-IR PCOS.
The mean age of the participants in this study was 
26.99 ± 4.88 years. This is similar to the mean age 
reported in studies in India (22 ± 5.0 years years) [26] and 
Iran (24.8 ± 5.6 years) [25]. This is most probably due to 
PCOS being a disease that is commoner among young 
women of childbearing age. The mean BMI of partici-
pants in this study was 29.84 ± 6.08 Kg/m2, and there is 
not much difference when compared with other stud-
ies. In a study of women with PCOS conducted in South 
Korea, the mean BMI was 25.1 ± 5.5Kg/m2 [27]. Also, 
the mean BMI of women with PCOS was reported to be 
28.4 ± 7.01Kg/m2 in Egypt [28]. This seems to suggest that 
PCOS is common among overweight women of child-
bearing age. Although these BMIs fall into the overweight 
category, it is difficult to ascribe this to weight gain due 
to PCOS alone as many other factors (such as diet, life-
style and, activity) could be responsible for weight gain. 
However, in this study, comparison between women with 
IR-PCOS and non-IR PCOS showed that the BMI of par-
ticipants with IR-PCOS was higher than the BMI of par-
ticipants with non-IR PCOS (31.07 ± 5.05 Vs 28.82 ± 6.37, 
p-value = 0.006). After regression analysis, BMI was sta-
tistically associated with IR-PCOS. This corroborates 
with findings from another study which showed that the 
insulin resistant patients were significantly more obese 
as shown by three different measures of adiposity; higher 
BMI (p < 0.0001), percentage of body fat (p < 0.002) and 
Waist-to-hip ratio (W/H) (p < 0.005) [29]. This highlights

PCOS + IR = Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and Insulin Resistance, PCOS - IR = Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome without Insulin Resistance
the link between IR and obesity/adiposity as measured by 
different methods.
Evidence from this work shows that majority of the 
participants had menstrual irregularity (89.19%) and just 
over half had some noticeable features of hyperandrogen-
ism; hirsutism (56.08%) and acne (52.70%). Likewise in a 
study in Thailand, 98.4% of women had oligomenorrhea 
or amenorrhea, and almost half of them (49.2%) had fea-
tures of hyperandrogenism [21].
Conclusion
Although this study confirms that the prevalence of 
insulin resistance amongst women with PCOS is high, 
it has not been able to prove that serum adiponectin 
can be used as a surrogate marker for insulin resistance 
in women with PCOS. Therefore, the determination of 
insulin resistance in women with PCOS is necessary in 
view of its high prevalence and implications on women’s 
health. More local studies are needed to confirm that 
serum Adiponectin and other adipocytokines can be 
used as surrogate markers for insulin resistance.
Strengths
This study contributes to the understanding of metabolic 
aspects in PCOS patients. Also, its comparative design 
allows for a direct comparison between women with 
PCOS with and without insulin resistance, providing 
insights into the potential differences in serum adiponec-
tin levels associated with insulin resistance.
Limitation
The study’s findings may be specific to the population in 
Lagos, and caution should be exercised when generaliz-
ing to other regions or populations with different demo-
graphic and healthcare characteristics.
