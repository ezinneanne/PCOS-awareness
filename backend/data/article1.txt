17% of Nigerian women with fertility-related issues have PCOS. This means it affects 1 in 6 Nigerian women, yet many remain undiagnosed due to limited awareness and access to healthcare. The true number of women living with PCOS in Nigeria is likely much higher than current reports, as no large-scale studies have been conducted to assess the full extent of the condition among Nigerian women.

PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal and metabolic condition that increases male hormones in women of reproductive age, leading to irregular menstrual cycles, mood changes, and excessive hair growth. Despite the name, the "
cysts
" in PCOS are not actual cysts in the ovaries. Instead, they are small, fluid-filled follicles that contain immature eggs, which appear cyst-like on an ultrasound. PCOS has no known
cause
and many women only discover the condition when they struggle to conceive.
Sometimes, it starts as irregular periods as a teenager
Like Jane, who found out she had PCOS after struggling to conceive for over two years.
" Looking back, I realise I‚Äôd been living with the symptoms since my teenage years. I remember my periods were irregular from as early as 15, sometimes showing up once every two months. But I thought nothing of it at the time. Then came the hair on my chin and chest, the constant fatigue, and the mood swings ‚Äîespecially in my early 20s. And once again, I brushed it off as just PMS or stress from school and life."
"As I moved into my late 20s and got married, the weight gain hit hard. I went from a size 6 to a size 14 within what felt like no time at all. Determined to get my health back on track, I threw myself into working out. I was at the gym consistently for months, but no matter what I did, the weight wouldn‚Äôt come off. It was frustrating and exhausting, like my body was fighting against me.
After two years of trying to conceive without any success, my husband and I finally went to the hospital. That‚Äôs when I was diagnosed with PCOS. It was a mix of emotions ‚Äî on the one hand, it was a relief to finally have an answer to everything I‚Äôd been going through. But on the other hand, it felt like I was facing a new problem I wasn‚Äôt prepared for."
"Much of the frustration that comes with managing PCOS isn't just from the lack of information, and unpreparedness; it also comes from the very place where women seek help."
Meet Ene, who was told she had 12 months to get married
Months without a period became the reason for her first visit to a fertility clinic. Sitting nervously in the waiting room, Ene hoped for answers but felt unprepared for what was to come. When it was her turn, the doctor requested a hormone profile, and Ene dutifully complied. Yet, when the results arrived, she was left confused by the numbers that held the answer to her struggles.
Unsure of how to interpret the data, Ene opted for consultation counselling, hoping to gain clarity. It was during this consultation that her path took an unexpected turn. The doctor she met was joined by two other specialists ‚Äî a gynaecologist and an endocrinologist. But instead of addressing her medical concerns, the focus shifted unsettlingly towards her relationship status. They pressed her to find a partner quickly, warning,
‚Äúget married within 12 months, as you might be infertile in the coming years.‚Äù
The word
"infertile"
echoed in her mind, leaving Ene feeling like a stranger in a room where decisions about her life were being made without her consent.
The most important place to start is speaking to the right doctor
As Ene tells us, much of the frustration that comes with managing PCOS isn't just from the lack of information, and unpreparedness; it also comes from the very place where women seek help.

to explore your options. Whether you're planning for pregnancy now or interested in freezing your eggs for the future, they can guide you through the process and provide the support you need.
A low glycemic index diet is almost always recommended
Your diet plays a crucial role in managing PCOS because it directly influences blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity ‚Äî a low glycemic index (GI) diet helps manage both by replacing high GI foods with low GI alternatives. Low GI foods are digested more slowly, keeping blood sugar levels stable and reducing insulin spikes. This enhances weight loss and improves overall health.

Up to 80% of women with PCOS struggle to keep fit
Asides eating healthy, exercise is another helpful lifestyle change that can help your cells be more responsive to insulin and boost your mood. The best type of exercise is a mix of strength training and aerobic exercise like brisk walking, swimming and dancing. Relying solely on cardio may not be the best approach as excessive cardio can increase your stress hormone and worsen weight gain.

Manage hirsutism with waxing
Hirsutism is a common symptom of PCOS that causes excessive hair growth in areas like the chest or chin, and waxing can be an effective method to manage this. It offers smoother skin that lasts for weeks, and it‚Äôs a practical option alongside other treatments such as laser hair removal or electrolysis.
Adding regular spa treatments or facials to your waxing routine can also enhance your confidence and overall well-being, helping you feel more comfortable.
