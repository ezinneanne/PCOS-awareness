Abstract

Background: Infertility remains an issue of concern especially to the female partner who bears the brunt of the stigma attributed to the disease 
in this environment. Among the identified etiological factors for infertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine 
disorder in women of reproductive age that impact on ovulation and conception. Aims and Objectives: The objective of this study was to 
determine pregnancy outcome following the various modalities of management of PCOS at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH). 
Materials and Methods: This is a nonrandomized (nonblinded) clinical trial of five therapeutic options for infertile women with PCOS from 
the Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Clinic and Gynaecology Clinic of UITH between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013. 
Results:  Of 624 infertile women who presented at ART and general gynecology clinic of UITH, 76 met the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS, giving 
a prevalence rate of 12.2%. The patients aged 20–44 years with a mean age of 31.5 years. Most 49 (64.5%) of the patients were nulliparous, and 
more than half (56.6%) belong to the middle social class. Thirty-four (44.8%) were obese while 22 (28.9%) were overweight. Of the various 
management options, 48.7% had laparoscopic ovarian drilling; other treatment options offered were the use of clomiphene citrate (CC) alone, 
CC with metformin, weight reduction, and gonadotropin. Patients were followed-up within 6–12 months (mean 5.5 ± 1.2 months) following the 
initial treatment for evidence of laboratory/clinical pregnancy. An overall pregnancy rate of 46.0% was recorded. However, a total of 13 (17.1%) 
were lost to follow-up. The highest pregnancy rate (75%) was reported in women managed with CC alone (P = 0.229). Conclusion: PCOS 
occurs commonly in reproductive age and management outcomes are promising in Nigeria. CC, metformin, and laparoscopic ovarian drilling 
are of great benefit. Further studies on PCOS in low resource countries are needed.

INTRODUCTION
The  polycystic  ovarian  syndrome  (PCOS)  also  known  as 
Stein‑Leventhal  syndrome  was  first  described,  in  1935,  by 
Stein  and  Leventhal.[1]  This  syndrome  is  characterized  by 
oligo-amenorrhea,  obesity,  infertility,  and  hirsutism.  It  is 
undoubtedly associated with long-term health sequelae such 
as diabetes mellitus, endometrial cancer, and cardiovascular 
disease among others.[1,2]

PCOS has a prevalence of 5–10% with variance among races 
and  ethnicities.[3] The  highest  reported  prevalence  has  been 
52%  among  South Asian  immigrants  in  Britain  of  whom 
49.1%  had  menstrual  irregularity.[4]  Up  to  10%  of  women 
are  diagnosed  with  PCOS  during  gynecologic  visits.[2] 



Approximately 50% of patients are hirsute, and 30–75% are 
obese.[3] The prevalence rate of 18.1% has been reported by 
Ugwu et al. in south eastern, Nigeria with the majority having 
infertility and oligo-menorrhea.[2] PCOS accounts for 75% of 
anovulatory infertility in childbearing women.[5]

PCOS affects premenopausal women, and the age of onset is 
most often perimenarchal (before bone age reaches 16 years).[2] 



In  lean  women  with  a  genetic  predisposition  to  PCOS,  the 
syndrome  may  be  unmasked  when  they  subsequently  gain 
weight.[2]

The exact underlying defect in PCOS is unknown, a genetic 
component is likely as PCOS tend to run in families, and the 
pattern of inheritance is X-linked dominance.[6] Family studies 
have  shown  that  about  50%  of  first  degree  relatives  have 
PCOS.[7] A presumptive diagnosis of PCOS often can be made 
based on the history and examination findings. According to 
an  international consensus,  the  syndrome  can  be  diagnosed 
using the Rotterdam criteria (presence of at least two of the 
following  conditions):  Oligo-menorrhea  or  amenorrhea, 
hyperandrogenism,  and  polycystic  ovaries  on  ultrasound. 
The morphology of polycystic ovaries has been defined as an 
ovary with 12 or more follicles measuring 2–9 mm in diameter 
and  increased  ovarian  volume  (>10  cm3)  on  transvaginal 
ultrasound (TVS).[8]

Management of PCOS is symptom oriented. The objectives 
are  to  restore  normal  menstruation;  ovulatory  cycles  and 
fertility; prevent endometrial hyperplasia/cancer and to treat 
acne;  and  infertility.  This  study  aimed  at  determining  the 
prevalence, sociodemographic characteristics, and outcomes 
of management modalities of PCOS in women with infertility. 
It  is  hoped  that  the  findings  from  this  study  will  enable  us 
identify the most effective therapeutic option for anovulatory 
PCOS in our locality since there is a paucity of knowledge in 
the provision of such care in our environment.

MATERIALS AND METhODS
This is a nonrandomized (nonblinded) clinical trial involving 
infertile women with PCOS, who had treatment for infertility 
at  the  Assisted  Reproductive  Technology  (ART)  clinic 
and  Gynaecology  Clinic  of  University  of  Ilorin  Teaching 
Hospital (UITH) between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 
2013.

Information  on  biosocial  data,  the  mode  of  treatment  and 
management outcomes were documented using a structured 
questionnaire.  Social  classes  were  determined  based  on 
patient’s education and her husband’s occupation as validated 
by Olusanya et al.[9] Similarly, the contacts (telephone numbers 
and home address) of the patients were collected. Furthermore, 
diagnostic  workup  including  hysterosalpingography/saline 
infusion  sonography,  transvaginal  ultrasonography,  and 
measurement  of  baseline  levels  of  follicle-stimulating 
hormone, leutinizing hormone, estradiol, thyroid-stimulating 
hormone,  triiodothyronine  (T3),  thyroxin  (T4),  prolactin, 
and  day  21  progesterone  were  carried  out  on  them  prior 
to  commencement  of  treatments.  In  addition,  the  spouse 
of  the  clients  also  had  a  seminal  fluid  analysis  done. 
Patients  with  abnormal  serum  prolactin  levels,  bilateral 
tubal  blockade  or  whose  husbands  had  abnormal  semen 
parameters  (sperm  count  <20  million/mL,  motility  <50%, 
morphology  <30%  [normal:  World  Health  Organization 
criteria]) were excluded from the study.

The patients were counseled on the five therapeutic options, 
and they made an informed decision. The treatment modalities 
employed included: Clomiphene citrate (CC) alone, CC with 
metformin, weight reduction, gonadotropins, and laparoscopic 
ovarian drilling (LOD). Patients who received metformin were 
given the tablets at the initial dose of 500 mg and increased in 
a stepwise fashion which was individualized during the first 
3 weeks to accommodate the side effects until patients were 
taking a total dose of 1500 mg/day. The patients were then 
asked to come for follow-up once they had a menstrual period, 
and  a  TVS  and  follicular  tracking  were  done  to  document 
evidence of follicular growth and ovulation on days 10 or 12, 
and 16 of cycle. Patients that received CC only were given CC 
at a dose of 50 mg on days 2–6. The TVS and follicular tracking 
were done to document follicular growth and ovulation on days 
10 or 12, and 16 of cycle. If there was the absence of ovulation, 
the  CC  dose  was  increased  stepwise  on  a  treatment  cycle 
basis (50 mg incremental dose per cycle) after a progesterone 
withdrawal  bleeds  to  a  maximum  of  200  mg.  If  there  was 
evidence of ovulation, but the patient did  not  get  pregnant, 
the same dosage was continued for a maximum of six cycles.

In the combination treatment group, metformin was given in a 
similar manner to the metformin only group. Clomiphene was 
given at a dose of 50 mg on days 2–6. The TVS and follicular 
tracking were done to document evidence of follicular growth 
and  ovulation  on  days  10  or  12,  and  16.  If  there  was  the 
absence of ovulation, the CC dose was increased stepwise on 
a treatment cycle basis after a progesterone withdrawal bleeds 
to a maximum of 200 mg. If there was evidence of ovulation, 
but  the  patient  did  not  get  pregnant,  a  similar  dosage  was 
continued for a maximum of six cycles.

In the gonadotropin group, intramuscular injection of highly 
purified human menopausal gonadotropin (Menopur; Ferring 
Pharmaceuticals, Kiel, Germany) was administered at a dose 
of 75 IU on day 6, 9, and 12 of cycle. The TVS and follicular 
tracking were done to document evidence of follicular growth 
and ovulation on days 10 or 12, and 16. If there was absence of 
ovulation, the gonadotropin dose was increased stepwise on a 
treatment cycle basis after a progesterone withdrawal bleed to 
a maximum of 300 IU. If there was evidence of ovulation but 
patient did not get pregnant, a similar dosage was continued for 
a maximum of six cycles. Weight reduction therapy in the form 
of dieting as recommended by the dietician (this includes eating 
lots of fruit and vegetables, choosing lean meats and low-fat 
dairy foods, as well as limiting the amount of fatty, and sugary 
foods, and drinks) and exercise was sustained for 6 months, 
and LOD was offered to patients who failed to ovulate after 
three treatment cycles with gradually increasing doses of CC 
prior to presentation (clomiphene resistant).

Patients were allocated to the treatment groups purposively 
and counseled on adequate coital exposure with their spouse 
during ovulation period between 12 and 15 days of menstrual 
cycle as determined by ovulation test kit (predict®; Unipath 
Diagnostics)  and  or  days  12–15  follicular  TVS  study. 
Patients were followed-up within 6 to 12 months following the initial treatment for the evidence of laboratory/clinical 
pregnancy.

Ethical approval was obtained from the departmental ethical 
committee of the ART unit of the hospital. The data retrieved 
were analyzed using a commercial statistical package (Statistical 
Package for the Social Sciences [SPSS] version 16.0, SPSS Inc. 
Chicago, IL, USA). The results are depicted using percentages.

RESULTS
Of 624 infertile women who had infertility consultation during 
the period under review at the ART and general gynecology 
clinics  of  UITH,  76  met  the  Rotterdam  criteria  for  PCOS, 
giving a prevalence rate of 12.2%. Of 76, a total of 57 (75.0%) 
patients were recruited from ART unit while 19 (25.0%) were 
from gynecology clinic. However, a total of 13 (17.1%) were 
lost to follow-up. In addition, a total pregnancy rate of 46.0% 
was recorded as 35 out of the 76 patients’ recruited attained 
pregnancy in 12 months. The patients aged 20–44 years with 
a mean of 31.5 years. The modal age group was 25–29 years. 
Forty-nine (64.5%) were nulliparous while 18 (23.7%) were 
primiparous, and the remaining nine (11.8%) were multiparous. 
Forty-three  of  them  (56.6%)  belong  to  the  middle  social 
class. Thirty-four (44.8%) were obese while 22 (28.9%) were 
overweight [Table 1].

The  various  treatment  options  offered  to  infertile  women 
with PCOS and pregnancy rates is shown in Table 2. Most 
37  (49%)  had  LOD.  Sixteen  (21%)  were  administered  CC 
alone.  Twelve  (16%)  received  gonadotropins.  Seven  (9%) 
received a combination of CC and metformin. Only four (5%) 
were  offered  weight  reduction.  The  patients  were  followed 
up within 6–12 months (mean 5.5 ± 1.2 months). However, 
a  total  of  13  (17.1%)  were  lost  to  follow-up  and  majority 
10  (77%)  belong  to  LOD  treatment  group. Among  those 
that were compliant to follow-up, the highest pregnancy rate 
was recorded among patients that received CC alone, where 
pregnancy rate of 75% was recorded.

The odds of pregnancy occurring is highest for CC and lowest 
for  weight  reduction  and  CC  +  metformin.  However,  odds 
ratio across the treatment groups involving comparing odds of 
weight reduction and CC (0.33/3.00 = 0.11) revealed that the 
odds of pregnancy occurring with weight reduction is lower 
than that of CC. Similarly, the odds of pregnancy occurring 
with  CC  seem  two  times  higher  than  with  Laparoscopic 
drilling  (3.00/1.25  =  2.4).  Comparing  the  odds  of  weight 
reduction  and  CC  +  Metformin  (0.33/0.33  =  1.00)  showed 
that there is no difference in pregnancy outcome between the 
two  groups.  However,  there  was  no  statistically  significant 
difference  in  the  pregnancy  outcome  across  the  various 
treatment modalities (χ2 = 5.63; P = 0.229) [Table 3].

DISCUSSION
In this study, the prevalence rate of PCOS was estimated to be 
12.2%. This compares favorably with a similar study carried

out in Niger-Delta University Teaching Hospital in southern 
Nigeria (12.2%),[10] but lower than the 32% reported by Pembe 
et al. in Tanzania, in 2009.[11] A higher prevalence rate of 18.1% 
was also reported in Enugu by Ugwu et al.[1] A lower prevalence 
rate of 2.2% was reported by Igwegbe et al. in Nnewi.[12] The 
differing  prevalence  rates  may  be  attributed  to  differences 
in  the  prevalence  rates  of  the  genetic  and  environmental 
determinants of PCOS in the various populations or differences 
in the study populations.

This study showed that, the majority of the women were within 
the age group 25–29 years, with a mean age of 31.5 years. 
This is similar to the findings in Enugu, Nigeria with a mean 
age of 30 years),[1] though slightly higher than the mean age 
of 27 years recorded in Nnewi, Nigeria.[12] However, this is 
not surprising as the PCOS is a complex endocrine disorder 
affecting women in their reproductive years.[1,12] Furthermore, 
the majority of the women (64.5%) were nulliparous. This 
is inconsonance with the findings in Nnewi, Nigeria where 
70%  of  the  study  population  were  nulliparous.[12]  The 
association of PCOS and its components with socioeconomic 
status (SES) might shed light on the role of the environment 
in  the  development  of  this  condition.  Research  has  shown 
that individuals with lower SES are more at risk for engaging 
in  adverse  health  behaviors  including  smoking,  lack  of 
physical activity, and poor nutritional diet[13,14] among women, 
obesity  is  associated  with  low  SES.[15,16]  Studies  have  also 
shown  that  smoking  and  obesity  can  exacerbate  insulin 
resistance,[17] which is a condition highly correlated with and 
part of the pathogenesis of PCOS. On the contrary, less than 
one-third  (31.6%)  of  the  study  population  belong  to  lower 
SES in this study.

Approximately 75% of women with PCOS are overweight.[6] 
This finding also agrees with the present study where 73.7% 
of women were either overweight and or obese. Improvement 
in lifestyle with a combination of exercise and diet to achieve 
weight reduction is important to enhance the prospects of both 
spontaneous and drug induced ovulation.[7] In this study, four 
women were offered weight reduction. Lifestyle modification 
and weight loss improves ovulation rate, fertility, and decrease 
in testosterone levels.[7] It is generally accepted that more than 
5–10% weight loss improves fertility and menstrual cycles in 
women with PCOS.[18]

CC,  an  ovulation  induction  drug  was  administered  to 
16 patients in this study, and a pregnancy rate of 75% was 
achieved  within  6  months  to  12  months  of  initiation  of 
treatment. This result is far higher as compared to a pregnancy 
rate  of  40%  reported  in  Nnewi[12]  and  38%  in  Enugu, 
Nigeria.[1] This could be attributed to the smaller sample size 
in  this  study  as  compared  to  Nnewi  and  Enugu  studies.  It 
has been recommended that when an ovulatory dose of any 
agent has been found, the patient should continue on it for 
6 months.[19] There is presently no consensus on the definition 
of clomiphene resistance, but most clinicians would define it as 
a failure to ovulate after three treatment cycles with gradually 
increasing doses of CC.[12]

A  Cochrane  review  has  confirmed  a  beneficial  effect  of 
metformin in increasing rates of ovulation when combined 
with  placebo  and  also  improving  both  rates  of  ovulation 
and  pregnancy  when  used  with  CC  compared  with  CC 
alone.[20] This is however, differ from findings in this study, 
where  the  highest  pregnancy  rate  (75%)  was  reported  in 
women managed with CC alone as against 25% in CC and 
metformin  group  possibly  due  to  limited  sample  size  in 
this study.

Parenteral  gonadotropin  therapy,  for  example,  human 
menopausal gonadotropin has been used. The drawback with 
this  medication  is  ovarian  hyperstimulation  syndrome  and 
multiple pregnancies. Though an expensive medication, only 
12 patients were able to purchase it and 6 out of the 12 (50%) 
conceived.

LOD or diathermy is a one-off therapeutic option for women 
with clomiphene resistant PCOS.[7,21] This procedure is free 
of  complications  such  as  multiple  pregnancy  and  ovarian 
hyperstimulation. It also does not require intensive ultrasound 
monitoring.  It  has  also  taken  the  place  of  wedge  resection 
of  the  ovaries  which  resulted  in  extensive  peri-ovarian  and 
tubal  adhesion.  Thirty-seven  women  had  LOD,  10  out  of 
these defaulted and a pregnancy rate of 55.6% was reported 
in those monitored.

One  major  limitation  of  this  study  was  the  small  number 
of  patients  used  in  the  study. Another  constraint  was  the 
limited  laboratory  resources  in  the  study  center;  hence, 
we  were  not  able  to  measure  other  blood  parameters  that 
would have been useful in the evaluation of PCOS such as 
dehydroepiandrosterone,  dehydroepiandrosterone  sulfate, 
sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and fasting insulin. 
Another limitation was that the pelvic ultrasound examinations 
were not done by same investigators using a vaginal endoprobe, 
and so there are chances of intra-observer bias. The baseline 
hormonal profiles were not repeated following medications, 
and so we could not assess the effects of medication on the 
hormonal  profile.  In  addition,  pregnant  patients  were  not 
followed up until an ultrasound could document the viability 
of pregnancy and copies of patients’ obstetric records including 
delivery  records  were  not  reviewed  by  the  investigators  to 
obtain birth outcomes.

CONCLUSION
PCOS is a common heterogeneous endocrine disorder occurring 
in one in eight infertile women in our locality. It occurs more 
often  in  nulliparous  women.  The  diagnosis  requires  a  high 
index of suspicion and management outcomes are promising 
in Nigeria. CC and insulin sensitizing agent (metformin) are 
of great benefit. However, when resistance to clomiphene is 
demonstrated, LOD offers hope. There is, therefore, need for 
further studies on PCOS in developing countries so as to X-ray 
the effects of various treatment modalities on improvement of 
pregnancy rates.
