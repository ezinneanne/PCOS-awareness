                What is PCOS?
            </h3> 
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. 
                Women with PCOS may have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. 
                The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs.

                <li>Irregular menstrual cycles (e.g., infrequent, irregular or prolonged)</li>
                <li>Excess androgen: Elevated levels of male hormones may result in physical signs, such as excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), and occasionally severe acne and male-pattern baldness.</li>
                <li>Polycystic ovaries: Your ovaries might be enlarged and contain follicles that surround the eggs. As a result, the ovaries might fail to function regularly.</li>
                <li>Weight gain or difficulty losing weight</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>

                Why is Diagnosis Important?
            </h3> 
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Early diagnosis and treatment of PCOS can help reduce the risk of long-term complications, 
                such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and endometrial cancer. 
                If you suspect you have PCOS, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional in Nigeria for proper evaluation and guidance.
